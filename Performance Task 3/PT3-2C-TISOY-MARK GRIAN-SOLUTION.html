        My experience in saving my money is to have your money well-managed, my
        advice is to make an piggy bank and everyday drop a penny in your piggy
        bank, also the most effective way to save a money, is take away your
        online shopping app such as Lazada, Shopee, Alibaba etc. because this
        app will cause you to buy excessively.
