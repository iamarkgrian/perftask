      <h2>Marvel: Avengers</h2>
      <p>
        Marvel’s Avengers begins at A-Day, where Captain America, Iron Man, the
        Hulk, Black Widow, and Thor are unveiling a hi-tech Avengers
        Headquarters in San Francisco — including the reveal of their own
        helicarrier powered by an experimental energy source. The celebration
        turns deadly when a catastrophic accident results in massive
        devastation. Blamed for the tragedy, the Avengers disband. Five years
        later, with all super heroes outlawed and the world in peril, the only
        hope is to reassemble Earth’s Mightiest Heroes.

      <h2>Captain America vs. Iron Man</h2>
      <p>
        After the Avengers defeated Ultron, Thor and Hulk are nowhere to be
        found. Hawkeye has gone home to spend time with his family. Even Iron
        Man has apparently disengaged. Captain America and Black Widow are
        leading a new team of Avengers, consisting of Scarlet Witch, Vision, War
        Machine and Falcon. But the world hasn't forgotten the numerous civilian
        casualties that resulted from the Avengers' previous missions.
        <br />
        Incensed, Iron Man attacks both Cap and Bucky, and he demands to know if
        Steve knew what had happened. Steve tells him that he only knew that
        Hydra was behind his parents' murder. They fight, and Iron Man blasts
        off Bucky's metal arm. Cap eventually disables Tony's arc reactor,
        rendering his suit useless. Tony tells him that he doesn't deserve to
        carry his shield that his father gave to Steve. Steve drops it and
        leaves with Bucky. Zemo is sitting outside, and Black Panther stands
        behind him. He tells Black Panther that his family was killed in
        Zokovia, and he wouldn't stop until he destroyed the Avengers from
        within. With his success, Zemo tries to commit suicide with a gun, but
        Black Panther places his hand over the barrel, stopping the bullet, and
        then apprehends Zemo for judgment.

      <h2>Thor</h2>
      <p>
        Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder, the former king of Asgard
        and New Asgard, and a founding member of the Avengers. When his
        irresponsible and impetuous behavior reignited a conflict between Asgard
        and Jotunheim, Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his
        power, and banished to Earth by Odin. While exiled on Earth, Thor
        learned humility, finding love with Jane Foster, and helped save his new
        friends from the Destroyer sent by Loki. Due to his selfless act of
        sacrifice, Thor redeemed himself in his father's eyes and was granted
        his power once more, which he then used to defeat Loki's schemes of
        genocide.

      <h2>Black Widow</h2>
      <p>
        Natalia Alianovna "Natasha" Romanoff, also known as Black Widow, was one
        of the most talented spies and assassins in the entire world and a
        founding member of the Avengers. Originally a KGB operative and
        dangerous assassin, Romanoff was recruited into S.H.I.E.L.D. by Clint
        Barton. Having extensive mastery in martial arts and armed with her
        Widow's Bite, Black Widow became one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most efficient
        agents. During one mission, she was sent undercover into Stark
        Industries to watch Tony Stark due to the fear that he was dying. During
        this mission, Romanoff assisted Stark with defeating Ivan Vanko's
        terrorist plots against him.
